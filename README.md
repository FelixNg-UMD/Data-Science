This repository contains three projects completed in Python using Google Colab. Each project explores a different dataset and applies various data science techniques, including data cleaning, hypothesis testing, and machine learning model development.

**PROJECT2**
Dataset: Survey responses from the 2023 and 2025 classes about their opinions on several questions.
What I did:
Pulled and cleaned the raw survey data.
Conducted hypothesis testing to determine whether there were significant differences between the two classes in their perspectives.

**PROJECT4**
Dataset: Reviews from PlanetTerp, a platform where UMD students share opinions about courses and professors.
What I did:
- Instead of using student ratings directly, I extracted features from the comment text and expected grade.
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including:
    Decision Tree Regressor
    Linear Regression
    Random Forest
- Compared model performance to identify the best predictor of professor ratings.

**PROJECT 5**
Dataset: Student attendance records combined with local weather data.
What I did:
- Built a time-series machine learning model to explore whether weather conditions influence student attendance.
- Evaluated the relationship between weather variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and attendance patterns.
